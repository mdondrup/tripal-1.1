 * Phenotype relationships with stocks are stored in the natural diversity tables.
 * If a stock has phenotypes associated then you can find the data by traversing
 * the foreign key (FK) relationships in this manner: 
 * 
 * stock => nd_experiment_stock => nd_experiment => nd_experiment_phenotype => phenotype.
 * 
 * You can find ancillary information about data associated with a phenotype such as
 * a contact, pub, protocol, project, genotype, dbxref by using the 
 * nd_experiment.nd_experiment_id value and traversing the other FK relationships
 * 
 * stock => nd_experiment_stock => nd_experiment => nd_experiment_phenotype => phenotype
 *                                               => nd_experiment_genotype => genotype
 *                                               => nd_experiment_project => project
 *                                               => nd_experiment_pub => pub
 *                                               => nd_experiment_contact => contact
 *                                               => nd_experiment_dbxref => dbxref
 *                                               => nd_experiment_protocol => protocol
 *                                               => nd_experiment_stockprop
 *                                               => nd_experiment_stock_dbxref
 * 
 * In the FK relationships shown above, the nd_experiment_id value represents a single 
 * experimental value that may have all of the ancilliary data associated with it.  
 * If the phenotype record shares an nd_experiment_id with a genotype, pub, contact,
 * protocol, etc then all of that data is associated with the phenotype and vice-versa.
 * 
 * Techincally, we can skip including the 'nd_experiment' table when traversing the FK's 
 * because we have the nd_experiment_id value when we get the nd_experiment_stock record.
